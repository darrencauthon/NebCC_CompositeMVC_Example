This is the "composite" version of the MVC Music Store that I presented during my "Composite MVC with MVC Turbine" presentation.

The main difference you'll notice between this version and the real MVC Music Store is the different versions in this version.  Instead of creating one MVC project and dumping **everything** into it, I created a separate MVC project for each of the main concerns of the site (Authentication, Catalog, and Checkout).

I have to warn you though -- this "composite" version is not completely broken out.  I only broke things out to the point where I could demonstrate the idea, but there is still more work needed to make this a fully-composite site.
